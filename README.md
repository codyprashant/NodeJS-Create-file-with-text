# NodeJS-Create-file-with-text
We have created Backend and Frontend sever where backend opens API endpoints for frontend to create new folder and files. Frontend also fetches all the files availble inside folder.

**Backend Server hosted at :** [https://file-folder-create.herokuapp.com/](https://file-folder-create.herokuapp.com/)

**Frontend Server hosted at :** [https://file-folder-create.netlify.app/](https://file-folder-create.netlify.app/)
